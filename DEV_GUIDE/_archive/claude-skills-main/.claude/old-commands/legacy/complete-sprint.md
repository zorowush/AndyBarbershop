# Sprint Retrospective Generator

**Sprint:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Workflow Chain

This command generates a comprehensive retrospective after all sprint epics are complete:

```
/create-epic-plan <epic-key>     → Creates Overview Document
         ↓
/generate-implementation-plan <overview-doc-url>  → Creates Implementation Plan
         ↓
/execute-ticket <ticket-key>     → Executes individual tickets
         ↓
/complete-epic <epic-key>        → Completes epic
         ↓
/complete-sprint <sprint-folder> → Sprint retrospective (YOU ARE HERE)
```

---

## Phase 0: Context Retrieval

1. **Determine sprint identifier:**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number (e.g., "1", "2"): Sprint [N]
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a path: Use as Confluence folder path
   - Default folder: `/Epics/Complete/Sprint [N]/`

2. **Locate all epic documents:**
   - Scan folder: `/Epics/Complete/Sprint [N]/`
   - Find all Overview Documents
   - Find all Implementation Plans
   - Find all Completion Reports

3. **FAILURE CONDITION - No Documents Found:**

   If no epic documents found in the sprint folder:

   **STOP and prompt the user:**
   ```
   I was unable to locate any completed epics in Sprint $ARGUMENTS.

   Searched location: [folder path]

   Please provide:
   1. Sprint number or folder path: [correct value]
   2. Confluence folder containing completed epics: [paste link]
   ```

   **DO NOT PROCEED** until confirmed.

4. **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - Sprint Document Confirmation:**

   ```
   Please confirm the following before generating retrospective:

   Sprint: $ARGUMENTS
   Folder: [Confluence folder path]

   Epics Found:
   - {Epic_Key_1}: {Epic_Title_1} ([X] tickets, [Y] points)
   - {Epic_Key_2}: {Epic_Title_2} ([X] tickets, [Y] points)
   - ...

   Total: [count] epics, [total tickets] tickets, [total points] story points

   Is this the correct sprint to analyze? (Yes / No / Correct)
   ```

   **DO NOT PROCEED** without explicit user confirmation.

## Phase 1: Document Collection & Analysis

1. **Read all documents in parallel:**
