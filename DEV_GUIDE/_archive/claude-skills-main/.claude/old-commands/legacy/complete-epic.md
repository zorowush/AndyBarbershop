# Complete Epic Workflow

**Epic Key:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Workflow Chain

This command completes an epic after all tickets have been executed:

```
/create-epic-plan <epic-key>     → Creates Overview Document
         ↓
/generate-implementation-plan <overview-doc-url>  → Creates Implementation Plan
         ↓
/execute-ticket <ticket-key>     → Executes individual tickets
         ↓
/complete-epic <epic-key>        → Completes epic (YOU ARE HERE)
         ↓
/complete-sprint <sprint-folder> → Sprint retrospective
```

---

## Phase 0: Context Retrieval

1. **Fetch the epic** from Jira using `{Epic_Key}`

2. **Extract from epic:**
   - `{Epic_Title}` - The epic title/name
   - `{Jira_Project}` - The Jira project URL
   - All linked tickets
   - Epic status

3. **Locate documentation:**
   - Find Overview Document in Confluence at `/Epics/In Progress/{Epic_Key}/`
   - Find Implementation Plan (subpage of Overview Document)

4. **FAILURE CONDITION - Missing Documentation:**

   If documentation cannot be found:

   **STOP and prompt the user:**
   ```
   I was unable to locate the required documents for epic {Epic_Key}.

   Please provide:
   1. Overview Document URL: [paste link]
   2. Implementation Plan URL: [paste link]
   ```

   **DO NOT PROCEED** until confirmed.

5. **MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - Epic Completion Readiness:**

   ```
   Please confirm the following before proceeding with epic completion:

   Epic: {Epic_Key} - {Epic_Title}
   Total Tickets: [count]
   Completed Tickets: [count]
   In Progress: [count]
   Blocked: [count]

   Overview Document: {Overview_Document}
   Implementation Plan: {Implementation_Plan}

   Are all tickets complete and ready to close this epic? (Yes / No / Review)
   ```

   - **Yes** → Continue to Phase 1
   - **No** → List incomplete tickets and exit
   - **Review** → Show detailed ticket status breakdown

   **DO NOT PROCEED** if there are incomplete tickets without explicit user override.

---

## Phase 1: Verification

1. **Verify all tickets are complete:**
   - Check Jira status for each ticket in the epic
   - Identify any tickets not in "Done" status
   - Check for any blocking issues or unresolved dependencies

2. **FAILURE CONDITION - Incomplete Tickets:**

   If any tickets are not complete:

   **STOP and report:**
   ```
   Epic {Epic_Key} has incomplete tickets:

   In Progress:
   - [TICKET-KEY]: [Title] - Status: [status]

   Blocked:
   - [TICKET-KEY]: [Title] - Blocker: [reason]

   To Do:
   - [TICKET-KEY]: [Title]

   Options:
   A) Complete remaining tickets first
   B) Move incomplete tickets to backlog and close epic
   C) Extend epic deadline and keep open

   What would you like to do? [A/B/C]
   ```

   **DO NOT PROCEED** without user decision.

3. **Review implementation quality:**
   - Check that all PRs related to epic tickets are merged
   - Verify test coverage meets 90% target
   - Review any documented deviations or technical debt

I will move the epic documentation from:
  FROM: /Epics/In Progress/{Epic_Key}/
  TO: /Epics/Complete/Sprint [N]/{Epic_Key}/

### 3. Update All Ticket Links
I will update all [count] tickets to point to the new location.

Proceed with these updates? (Yes / No / Modify)
```

**DO NOT UPDATE** documentation without explicit approval.

## Failure Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Epic not found | Error message, ask user to verify epic key |
| Incomplete tickets exist | Report incomplete tickets, wait for user decision |
| Documentation not found | Ask user for document locations |
| Cannot move Confluence pages | Ask user to move manually, provide instructions |
| Cannot close epic in Jira | Report error, provide manual instructions |
| Missing git history/PRs | Generate report with available data, note gaps |

## Output

**When complete, you MUST provide:**

```
## Epic Completion Successful!

**Epic:** {Epic_Key} - {Epic_Title}

### Summary
- Total Story Points: [planned] → [actual]
- Total Tickets: [count] completed
- Duration: [start date] → [end date] ([X] days)
- Test Coverage: [%] (target: 90%)
- Follow-up Tickets: [count] created

### Documentation
- **Completion Report:** {Completion_Report_URL}
- **Overview Document:** {Overview_Document} (updated)
- **Implementation Plan:** {Implementation_Plan}
